# The palisade-classpath-jars PV is set to a reclaim policy of DELETE
# In the future we may want to set the policy to RETAIN, in this situation where a
# helm upgrade makes a modification to the PV
# then we need to force the PVC to also be deleted.
# hence we need to hash or sha the PV as an annotation

#N.B The classpathjars would theoretically only need accessMode ReadOnlyMany
#however, the CSI driver's plugin GetVolumeHandle method determines whether
#the volume is actually used by other pods as a different mode
#there is quite a good explanation here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/issues/100
#as to the slightly anomalous behaviour
