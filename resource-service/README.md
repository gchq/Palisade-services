(`*` marks an indexable field)

### Motivation
To ease load on an external resource-service provider, a cache-like storage mechanism is used to return data for previously-queried resources.
The code for this can be found in the [StreamingResourceServiceProxy](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/service/StreamingResourceServiceProxy.java) and [JpaPersistenceLayer](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/repository/JpaPersistenceLayer.java).

Due to the tree-structure of filesystems, na√Øve caching of requests-responses results in a large amount of data while not providing any "smart" methods to the caching mechanism.
For example, requesting `/some/directory/with-lots-of-files` may return (and cache) 1000 resources, but requesting `/some/directory` will result in a cache miss, as would `/some/directory/with-lots-of-files/big-subdirectory`.
Instead, a persistence store is used to break resource trees apart into their individual nodes and store them separately, reconstructing parents and tree structure when requested again.

### Implementation
The persistence store is split into a number of separate repositories, one for each queryable index on a resource (i.e. resource-id, type, format).
These indexable fields are referred to in code through an EntityType enum.
These each store only "complete" sets of information - directories for which have been queried in their entirety, either by directly requesting it, or requesting one of its parents.
A separate repository stores pairs of resource-ids and entity-types.

### Example
A request to the resource-service may then look like:
* Get resources by some indexable field (or member of the [`EntityType` enum](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/domain/EntityType.java) enum, say `resource-id`)
* Check the [Completeness Repository](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/repository/CompletenessRepository.java) for whether the "cache" can return a "complete" set of information
    * If the `entity-type`-`resource-id` pair is found, continue to return from our "cache", otherwise return from the real resource-service
* Get by the indexable field in the appropriate repository
    * [Type Repository](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/repository/TypeRepository.java) and [Serialised Format Repository](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/repository/SerialisedFormatRepository.java) are not tree-like and return a collection of leaf-resource-ids to directly get-and-return
    * [Resource Repository](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/repository/ResourceRepository.java) is tree-like, so we need to recursively get the child resources
        * Query the repository recursively for a collection of resources with a parent matching our current node
* Re-assemble the parents of all our leaf-resources
    * Query the [Resource Repository](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/palisade/service/resource/repository/ResourceRepository.java) for resources matching our node's parent-id
* Return the completed result

This can all be achieved with a Java Streams pipeline, allowing for reasonable latency and parallelization.
