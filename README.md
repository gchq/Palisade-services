## Scalable Data Access Policy Management and Enforcement

### Project Build

This is a classic multi-module maven java project with a Spring Boot Parent.
Each module defines an individual service endpoint within Palisade (except for the services-manager module).
Each module is configured to build a docker container embedded with the jar and to install it into the configured registry or cache (except for the discovery-service and services-manager modules).
```
mvn clean install
```

To build an individual service:
```
mvn clean install -pl <module name>
```

Having completed updates to an individual service, deployment into the cluster can be triggered by updating the image tag.
This tag is composed of a combination of the release tag and of the git hash (of the local repo).
This is achieved via profile activation (**pi**, "push image"), eg:
```
mvn clean install -pl <module name> -P pi
```


### Considerations for running under Windows

In order to mount local directories to the data service, ***Windows users*** may find it necessary to adjust their firewall settings or change the network category for the "vEthernet (DockerNAT)" card to private via PowerShell:
```
Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (DockerNAT)" -NetworkCategory Private
```
This may be required to be repeated after docker updates or system reboots.

Further, ***Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users*** should note that the directory root must be configured as /c/Users... and not /mnt/c/Users... as this is configured as a network mount.
To do this, create a file called /etc/wsl.conf under linux and add the following:
```
[automount]
root = /
options = "metadata"
```
Changes will require a reboot to take effect.


### Helm Install

It is recommended that Palisade is released to Kubernetes via helm using the templates included within this project.
As a prerequisite, the helm client will need to be installed on the client and the Kubernetes context will need to be configured to point at the target cluster.
```
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context <name>
```

Example first deployment to a local cluster (from the project root directory):
```  
helm upgrade --install palisade . \
  --set global.persistence.dataStores.palisade-data-store.local.hostPath=${pwd}  \
  --set global.persistence.classpathJars.local.hostPath=${pwd}  \
  --timeout=200s
```
The working directory from `$(pwd)` will be used as the mount-point for the data-service, as well as for finding classpath-jars.
Kafka and redis persistence is mounted using the `/tmp` directory by default.

An example second deployment may want to use traefik to enable access into the cluster.
This can be done by adding the additional flag:
```
  --set trefik.install=true
```
This will deploy the traefik ingress controller - the application will be available at `http://localhost/palisade` and the traefik dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/`.

Multiple instances of Palisade may be deployed on the same cluster, separated by namespace.
The ingress controller will be configured to provide a route via that namespace.
It is required that the namespace exists prior to the installation:
```
kubectl create namespace testing
helm upgrade --install test . --namespace testing --set traefik.install=true
```

This will deploy an additional instance of Palisade called `test` which may be accessed at `http://localhost/testing/palisade`


### Helm Upgrade

Helm will only deploy artifacts to the cluster that, on upgrade, are new or changed.
Pods that require re-deployment must advance the image tag using the "push image" profile during the build, as shown above.


### Generated Deployment Names

It is possible to let helm generate the deployment name and let the chart create a new namespace for it, then deploy it there:
```
helm upgrade --install --generate-name . --set global.uniqueNamespace=true
```

Some more important arguments are as follows:

| Argument                                | Definition
|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------
| --timeout                               | If the post-install create-kafka-queues job fails, increase the timeout, **default is 60s**, **recommendation is 200s**
| **Local Deployments**                   |
| global.persistence.**xxx**.hostPath     | The host directory to use as a mount point for internal volumes
| **AWS Deployments**                     |
| global.persistence.**xxx**.volumeHandle | The handle of an AWS EFS volume to use for mounting
| global.persistence.**xxx**.volumePath   | The EFS volume directory to use as a mount point for internal volumes
| **Optional Installs**                   |
| traefik.install                         | Install the traefik ingress controller, **default=false**
| metrics-server.install                  | Install the metrics-server to enable horizontal scaling, **default=false**
| dashboard.install                       | Install the kubernetes dashboard, **default=false**
| global.kafka.install                    | Install Kafka and Zookeeper, **default=true**
| global.redis.install                    | Install Redis, **default=true**
| global.redis-cluster.install            | Install Redis-cluster, **default=false**
| global.redisClusterEnabled              | Set to true to use Redis-cluster or false to use Redis. Useful if redis is already installed. **default=false**

#### Redis vs Redis-Cluster
The key difference is scalability, write-points, sharding and partitioning.
* Redis will support a single (master) write-point with many replicated (slave) read-points.
* Redis-cluster will support sharding across the keyspace such that keys are uniquely mapped to one of many partitions, each partition with a single write-point and many read-points as above.

Recommended reading: [Amazon AWS documentation, Redis with Cluster Mode enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Replication.Redis-RedisCluster.html)
Redis is simpler, but will bottle-neck on write-requests to the single master node, eventually.

#### Kubernetes Dashboard
If the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) is required it must be installed separately as a prerequisite.
The `dashboard.install` switch installs ingress definitions into traefik for access at `https://localhost/kubernetes`.
Access to the dashboard should be by token, which can be obtained by running the following command against the cluster:
```
kubectl -n kube-system describe secrets \
  `kubectl -n kube-system get secrets | awk '/clusterrole-aggregation-controller/ {print $1}'` \
  | awk '/token:/ {print $2}'
```


### Changing Application Logging Level

All instances of the palisade-service pod contain a script that will identify all application pods in that release and change their log level at runtime:
```
kubectl exec -it palisade-service-7bb4d75d85-g8cgx -- bash /usr/share/palisade-service/log-level -t
```

Use the `-h` flag to see usage instructions.
