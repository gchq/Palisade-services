### Scalable Data Access Policy Management and Enforcement

#### Project Build

This is a classic multi-module maven java project with a Spring Boot Parent. Each module defines an individual service endpoint within Palisade
(with the exception of the service-launcher module). Of those services all of them are configured to build a docker container embedded with the
shaded jar and install it into the configured registry or cache (with the exception of the discovery-service).

```mvn clean install```

To build an individual service:

```mvn clean install -pl <module name>```

Having completed updates to an individual service forward deployment into the cluster can be triggered by updating the image tag which is composed
of a combination of the release tag and the git hash (of the local repo). This is achieved via profile activation (**pi**, "push image"). Eg:

```mvn clean install -pl <module name> -P pi```

#### Helm installation

It is recommended that Palisade is released to Kubernetes via helm using the templates included 
within this project. As a prerequisite the helm client will need to be installed on the client 
and the Kubernetes context configured to point at the target cluster.

```kubectl config get-contexts```

```kubectl config use-context <name>```

All deployment parameters are defined in the root ```values.yaml``` file, see inline comments for details.

Example first deployment to a local cluster (from the project root directory) :

```helm upgrade --install palisade . --set traefik.install=true```

This will deploy the traefik ingress controller and install Palisade with a deployment name of "palisade" into the defult namespace
so that the application will be available at ```http://localhost/palisade``` and the traefik dashboard will be available at 
```http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/```.

Multiple instances of Palisade may be deployed on the same cluster, separated by namespace. The ingress controller will be configured
to provide a route via that namespace. It is required that the namespace exists prior to the installation:

```kubectl create namespace testing```

```helm upgrade --install test . --namespace testing```

This will deploy an additional instance of Palisade called test which may be accessed at ```http://localhost/testing/palisade```

#### Helm upgrade

Helm will only deploy artifacts to the cluster on upgrade that are new or changed. Pods that require re-deployment must advance the
image tag using the "push image" profile during the build, as shown above.

#### Generated deployment names

It is possible to let helm generate the deployment name and let the chart create a new namespace for it, then deploy it there:

```helm upgrade --install --generate-name . --set global.uniqueNamespace=true```
