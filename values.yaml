# hosting: local, metal or cloud and defines configuration parameter choices for some child charts according to deployment environment
# install: install the traefik ingress controller, this should be true for the first installation into the cluster as it resides in kube-system to provide a single cluster-wide ingress controller
# install: install routing through the ingress controller to a pre-installed kubernetes dashboard i.e. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/
# hostname: the external hostname of the ingress, this may be the cluster master or public load-balancer
# nodes: the number of nodes in the cluster, this will be used to calculate the service scaling factors
# namespace: the target namespace, overridden by (1) --namespace (helm, the preferred override) or (2) global.uniqueNamespace=true, ingress path will include this name at the path root (default truncated to null)
# uniqueNamespace: if true (and this is a new install) the generated deployment name will be used as the namespace name too, ingress path will include this name at the path root eg. localhost/lazy-goat/palisade
# repository: the name of the docker image repository that is the source of local application images that was populated during the project build process and will now be referenced in the pods
