### Palisade Services Manager



## Documentation

The documentation for the latest release can be found [here](https://gchq.github.io/Palisade).



## Getting started

The Palisade Services Manager is a configuration-driven process-spawner and REST-client with particular considerations to assist in managing multiple Palisade services running on local JVMs.

The manager is designed to be used by defining a collection of SpringBoot configuration files:
 * One set for the manager itself - this defines how it should start up further services or reconfigure those already running
    * These are located in the service-manager's `resources` directory
 * One set for each service - these are discovered through the above configuration and passed on as an argument to the service jar
    * These are located in each service's `resources` directory
 
The manager works in several modes, operated by the use of several flags:
 * `--manager.mode=run` - run the *schedule*, in turn running a sequence of *tasks*, with each task running a collection of *services*
 * `--manager.mode=shutdown` - shutdown the services in the opposite order to how they were started in the schedule
 * `--manager.mode=loggers` - perform a change to the logging level of configured services by REST requests (POST /actuator/loggers/*)
 * `--manager.mode=config` - print out a human-readable view of the spring-boot configuration given to the services-manager, useful for debugging

When set to the `run` mode, the manager breaks down possible jobs as follows:

#### `--manager.mode=run`
Complete the configured *schedule*.

#### `--manager.schedule=...`
An ordered list of *task names*, where each task is started and waited upon until completion.
The schedule will fail-fast if any task fails, and is only completed successfully once all tasks complete successfully.

#### `--manager.tasks=...`
A map of *task names* to unordered collections of *service names*.
The task will fail if any service halts with failure, and is completed successfully once every service is healthy or halted with success. 

#### `--manager.services=...`
A map of *service names* to a number of configuration settings, forming a convenience wrapper around a ProcessBuilder that will spawn a daemonised `java -jar` process.
To complete successfully, a service either halts with success or responds `200 OK {status=UP}` to a health check (`GET http://<service-name>/actuators/health`).



## Examples

### Starting Services (`--manager.mode=run` / `--manager.mode=shutdown`)
Using the built-in profiles, the services-manager can be used to perform a number of common tasks, starting the services in different environments for different use-cases:  

#### `discovery` / `palisade` - Default configuration of discovery service / palisade services
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=discovery target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
# or
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=palisade target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
```
 * Will start just the discovery-service / all other palisade services respectively
 * Mostly used as a dependency and common set of configurations by other profiles


#### `static` - Simple setup with static 808x port numbers
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=static target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
```
 * By default, palisade-service will be at `localhost:8084` and data-service will be at `localhost:8082`
 * No eureka dashboard here, but take a look at the /actuator endpoints for some metadata
 
 
#### `eureka` - Eureka discovery, dynamic ports, 'scalable'
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=discovery target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar # start discovery-service without eureka (it is eureka)
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=eureka target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar    # start all other services with eureka
```
 * Once the manager has finished running, check the eureka dashboard at `localhost:8083`
 * These two commands will only exit once all services are ready, so the two `java -jar ...` commands can be chained together as `java .. discovery -jar .. && java .. eureka -jar ...`


---
***All further profiles require the discovery service to be running, or require some tweaking to use the static setup.***  
**The choice here between `eureka` or `static` profiles will be referred to unilaterally as the `environment` profile - make sure to substitute as appropriate.**  
---


#### `example-libs` - Pre-populated Palisade example (see [example-library](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-examples/tree/develop/example-library))
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=example-libs target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
```
 * Ensure first to start the discovery-service as above
 * Services will start up with their cache/persistence-store prepopulated with example data


#### `example-runner` - Automated execution of Palisade client on example data (see [example-runner](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-examples/tree/develop/example-runner))
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=example-runner target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
```
 * Ensure first to start the discovery-service as above
 * Services will start up with their cache/persistence-store prepopulated with example data
 * The rest-example will run once all services have started
 * Check `rest-example.log` for output data

The data used in this example comes checked-in to the repo and does not need generating
 
 
#### `example-perf` - Automated execution of Palisade performance tests on example data (see [performance](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-examples/tree/develop/performance))
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=example-perf target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
```
 * Ensure first to start the discovery-service as above
 * Services will start up with their cache/persistence-store prepopulated with example data
 * The performance-test will run once all services have started
 * Check `performance-test.log` for output data
 
The data used in this example contains numerous large files, as a result they do not come checked-in with the repo.
Instead, they must be generated before running the performance tests.

Either enable generation of performance test data as part of the services-manager `example-perf` configuration:
 * Change the above command to include the (previously unused) `performance-create-task`:
    ```bash
    java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=example-perf target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --manager.schedule=performance-create-task,palisade-task,performance-test-task
    ```
Or manually generate the data:  
 * From the [Palisade-examples](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-examples/) directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    java -jar performance/target/performance-*-exec.jar --performance.action=create
    ```



### Changing Logging Levels / Enabling Debug Logging (`--manager.mode=loggers`)

#### At Start-Time
If services are not running, or debug logging is required from startup, using the built-in profiles:  
 * *For the appropriate `environment`*, add the `debug` profile during the manager's run command - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=environment,debug target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --manager.mode=run` 
 * The `logging.level.uk.gov.gchq.palisade=DEBUG` configuration value will be set for all services at start-time 
   * Services should now log at `DEBUG` level from startup  

#### During Runtime
If services are already running, using the built-in profiles:  
 * *For the appropriate `environment`*, add the `debug` profile and use the manager's logging command - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=environment,debug target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --manager.mode=loggers`
 * A POST request will be made to Spring logging actuators 
   * Running services should now begin logging at `DEBUG` level (note that this will not include past debug log content, only debug messages created from now onwards)  



### Creating a new Configuration (`--manager.mode=config`)
Take a look at the [default configuration file](/services-manager/src/main/resources/application.yaml)  
When testing your new configuration, you may find the config flag useful:
 1. Write a new configuration `application-mynewprofile.yaml`
 1. See what the services-manager has been given by Spring - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mynewprofile target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --manager.mode=config` (the Java object representing the configuration should be printed to screen)  
 1. Need a little more? Also add the `debug` profile - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mynewprofile,debug target/services-manager-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --manager.mode=config`
