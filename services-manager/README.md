### Palisade Services Manager


## Documentation

The documentation for the latest release can be found [here](https://gchq.github.io/Palisade).


## Getting started

The Palisade Services Manager is a configuration-driven process-spawner and REST-client with particular considerations to assist in managing multiple Palisade services running on local JVMs.

The manager is designed to be used by defining a collection of SpringBoot configuration files:
 * One set for the manager itself - this defines how it should start up further services or reconfigure those already running
 * One set for each service - these are discovered through the above configuration and passed on as an argument to the service jar
    * These wll all already be located in each service's `resources` directory
 
 The manager works in several modes, operated by the use of several flags:
 * `--run` - run the configured services, spawning a new process for each entry
 * `--logging` - perform a change to the logging level of configured services by REST requests
 * `--config` - print out a human-readable view of the spring-boot configuration given to the services-manager
 
 
## Examples

### Starting Services
If services are already running, using the built-in profiles:  
 1. Start Eureka - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=eureka services-manager-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --run` 
    * Wait for Eureka to start up on `localhost:8083`
 3. Start all other services - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=services services-manager-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --run` 
    * Services should now begin registering with Eureka and appear on the dashboard
 4. Begin using Palisade (see [palisade-examples](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-examples))  

### Enabling Debug Logging

#### At Start-Time
If services are not running, or debug logging is required from startup, using the built-in profiles:  
 1. Start Eureka as above
 2. Add the `debug` profile to the services runner - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=services,debug services-manager-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --run` 
    * Services should now log at `DEBUG` level from startup  
 
#### During Runtime
If services are already running, using the built-in profiles:  
 1. Make a POST to Spring logging actuators - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=debug services-manager-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --logging` 
    * Services should now begin logging at `DEBUG` level (note that this will not include past debug logs) 

### Creating a new Configuration
Take a look at the example configuration file:
```yaml
manager:
  # Search up path hierarchy for the root directory by name
  # This allows the services-manager to be less dependant on where it is located and where it was run from
  root: palisade-services

  services:
     # Example configuration for a service "my-service" with a single class under my.service.MainApplication
     # Where appropriate, each entry is formatted as "TAG: [VALUE] :: USAGE - DESCRIPTION"
    
     my-service:                                               # "spring.application.name=${my-service}" - tag for the service being managed, should match with the service's Spring Boot application name (in eureka)
       classpath:                                              # "java -cp ${classpath[0]}:${classpath[1]}" - classpaths for service and external includes, path-separator-separated list (colon or semicolon)
         - "my-service-exec.jar"                               # first path likely is the compiled (executable) jar
         - "/data/types.jar"                                   # then any additional libraries added at runtime (serialised datatypes)
       config: "my-service/target/classes"                     # "java -Dspring.config.location=${config}" - Spring Boot configs filepath, singleton filepath
       launcher: org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher   # "java [-cp ...] ${launcher}" - jvm entrypoint classpath, singleton class
       main: my.service.MainApplication                        # "java -Dloader.main=${main}" - springboot entrypoint classpath, singleton class
       profiles:                                               # Spring Boot profiles to enable, comma-separated list
         - default                                             # "java -Dspring.profiles.active=${profiles[0]},${profiles[1]}"
       log: my-service.log                                     # "java [args] > ${log}" - logging output filepath, singleton filepath
       err: my-service.err                                     # "java [args] 2> ${err}" - error output filepath, singleton filepath
       level:                                                  # "java -Dlogging.level.${level.key}=${level.value}" - same format as spring's standard logging changes, classpath-loglevel map
         my.service.MainApplication: "INFO"                    # ALSO http POST address /actuator/loggers/${key}, body "configuredLevel=${value}" - classpath to change and logging level to change to
```
When testing your new configuration, you may find the config flag useful:
 1. Write a new configuration `application-mynewprofile.yaml`
 2. See what the services-manager has been given by Spring - run `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mynewprofile services-manager-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --config` and the Java object representing the configuration should be printed  
 3. Need more? Add the debug profile too - run `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=debug,mynewprofile services-manager-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --config`
