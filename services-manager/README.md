### Palisade Services Launcher

## Documentation

The documentation for the latest release can be found [here](https://gchq.github.io/Palisade).

## Getting started

The Palisade Services Launcher is a configuration-driven process runner with particular considerations to assist in running multiple Palisade services in a local JVM.

The launcher is designed to be used by defining a collection of SpringBoot configuration files:
 * One for the launcher itself - this defines how it should start up further services
 * One for each service - these are discovered through the above configuration and passed on as an argument to the service jar
 
 The launcher configuration further defines two types of configurations:
 * A list of configurations for each service to be run - required fields are:
    * target (SpringBoot-enabled JAR to run)
    * config (directory to pass to `-Dspring.config.location=<...>`)
    * profiles (profiles to pass to `-Dspring.profiles.active=<...>`, `default` for JAR default profile)
    * log (can be `/dev/null` for no logging)
 * One default configuration - for any required field not defined in the services, its value is deduced from the defaults:
    * The `root` directory is the first directory matching the field value after traversing up the directory tree from the working directory
       * Running the launcher from any subdirectory of `palisade-service` does not change application behaviour
    * A further string substitution is performed on any missing required field - any instance of the keyword `SERVICE` for the appropriate service name defined in the `name` field

## Examples

### Default Launcher Configuration
By default, the launcher configuration looks as follows:
```$xslt
launcher:
  default-service:
    root: palisade-services
    name: default
    target: SERVICE/target/SERVICE-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
    config: SERVICE/classes
    profiles: default
    log: SERVICE.log
  services:
    -
      name: audit-service
   ...
```
When loaded, instances of the keyword `SERVICE` are substituted per-service for that service's name.
In this case, the configuration is equivalent to `java -jar audit-service/target/audit-service-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar > audit-service.log 2 &> 1`

This default configuration is enough to launch all Palisade services given the existing directory structure and enabling/disabling services can be done using the command-line arguments:  
`java -jar services-launcher.jar --enable=example-service --enable=another-service --disable=unneccessary-service`

Each service enabled from the command line arguments is instantiated the same as the above services are - a overriden name applied to the default config.

### Disabling Logging
The default configuration pipes stdout and stderr to log files for each service.
To disable this, a single change is required to the configuration which can be accomplished using the `nologs` profile provided in `application-nologs.yaml`.

Execute:  
`java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=nologs,default services-launcher.jar`

Launcher's `application-nologs.yaml` (provided in the jar and available in services-launcher/target/classes):
```$xslt
launcher:
  default-service:
    log: /dev/null
```

### Enabling Eureka - Per-Service
By default across Palisade services, Eureka service discovery is disabled.
A common use-case may then be to start _some_ services (here, just the audit-service) with Eureka enabled, while leaving others unmodified.

Execute:  
`java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=with-eureka,default services-launcher.jar`

Launcher's `application-with-eureka.yaml`:
```$xslt
launcher:
  services:
    -
      name: audit-service
      profiles: eureka-service,default
    -
      name: discovery-service
   ...
```

Service's `application-eureka-service.yaml` (either in the local directory or for each service in SERVICE/target/classes):
```$xslt
eureka:
  client:
    enabled: true
```

_Note that the discovery service has Eureka enabled by default, so does not need a configuration file defined._  

### Enabling Eureka - Globally
Similarly to the above, a deployed system may require Eureka enabled for _all_ services, as well as per-service configurations for some services.

Execute:  
`java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=with-eureka,default services-launcher.jar`

Launcher's `application-with-eureka.yaml`:
```$xslt
launcher:
  default-service:
    profiles: eureka-service,default
  services:
    -
      name: audit-service
      profiles: audit,eureka-service,default
    -
      name: discovery-service
   ...
```

Service's `application-eureka-service.yaml`:
```$xslt
eureka:
  client:
    enabled: true
```

Audit Service's `application-audit.yaml`:
```$xslt
# further configuration here
```
