### Palisade Services Manager



## Documentation

The documentation for the latest release can be found [here](https://gchq.github.io/Palisade).



## Getting started

The Palisade Services Manager is a configuration-driven process-spawner and REST-client with particular considerations to assist in managing multiple Palisade services running on local JVMs.

The manager is designed to be used by defining a collection of SpringBoot configuration files:
 * One set for the manager itself - this defines how it should start up further services or reconfigure those already running
 * One set for each service - these are discovered through the above configuration and passed on as an argument to the service jar
    * These wll all already be located in each service's `resources` directory
 
 The manager works in several modes, operated by the use of several flags:
 * `--run` - run the *schedule*, in turn running a sequence of *tasks*, with each task running a collection of *services*
 * `--shutdown` - shutdown the services in the opposite order to how they were started in the schedule
 * `--loggers` - perform a change to the logging level of configured services by REST requests (POST /actuator/loggers/*)
 * `--config` - print out a human-readable view of the spring-boot configuration given to the services-manager, useful for debugging
 
 
 
## Examples

### Starting Services
Using the built-in profiles, the services-manager can be used to perform a number of common tasks, starting the services in different environments for different use-cases:  
 * Services using Eureka 
   * First start the discovery-service in a static-like way - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=discovery executable.jar --manager.mode=run` 
   * Once the manager is finished running, check the eureka dashboard at `localhost:8083` 
   * Next start all other palisade services using the discovery-service for service discovery - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=eureka executable.jar --manager.mode=run` 
   * These two commands will only exit once all services are ready, so the two `java -jar ...` commands can be chained together as `java -jar .. && java -jar ...`
 * Services using static ports
   * Just a single command - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=static executable.jar --manager.mode=run` 
   * No eureka dashboard here, but take a look at the /actuator endpoints for some metadata 
   * By default, palisade-service will be at `localhost:8084` and data-service will be at `localhost:8082` 
 * Pre-populated Palisade example (see [palisade-examples](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-examples)) 
   * For even more automation, the start-services (above) -> configure-services (example) -> run-example (example) steps can be performed in one go 
     * First start the discovery-service as above - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=discovery executable.jar --manager.mode=run` 
     * Start up services with pre-populated example data and run the rest example, run using the example profile - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=example executable.jar --manager.mode=run`

**The choice here between `eureka` or `static` profiles will be referred to unilaterally as the `environment` profile - make sure to substitute as appropriate**  



### Enabling Debug Logging

#### At Start-Time
If services are not running, or debug logging is required from startup, using the built-in profiles:  
 * *For the appropriate `environment`*, add the `debug` profile during the manager's run command - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=environment,debug executable.jar --manager.mode=run` 
 * The `logging.level.uk.gov.gchq.palisade=DEBUG` configuration value will be set for all services at start-time 
   * Services should now log at `DEBUG` level from startup  
 
#### During Runtime
If services are already running, using the built-in profiles:  
 * *For the appropriate `environment`*, add the `debug` profile and use the manager's logging command - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=environment,debug executable.jar --manager.mode=loggers`
 * A POST request will be made to Spring logging actuators 
   * Running services should now begin logging at `DEBUG` level (note that this will not include past debug log content, only debug messages created from now onwards)  



### Creating a new Configuration
Take a look at the [default configuration file](/services-manager/src/main/resources/application.yaml)

When testing your new configuration, you may find the config flag useful:
 1. Write a new configuration `application-mynewprofile.yaml`
 1. See what the services-manager has been given by Spring - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mynewprofile executable.jar --manager.mode=config` (the Java object representing the configuration should be printed to screen)  
 1. Need a little more? Also add the `debug` profile - `java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mynewprofile,debug executable.jar --manager.mode=config`
