  main:
    allow-bean-definition-overriding: true

# Options at the command line include:
# --run : Run services according to the schedule
# --shutdown : Shutdown service according to the schedule (reversed)
# --logging : Alter the logging level for all known services
# --config : Print out the loaded configuration (for debugging the manager)
manager:
  # Search up path hierarchy for the root directory by name
  # This allows the services-manager to be less dependant on where it is located and where it was run from
  root: Palisade-services

  # Available modes: run, shutdown, loggers, [default] config
  #
  # run: for each task in the schedule, for each service under that task, start the jar file and wait until healthy (GET /actuator/health) or exited
  # shutdown: for each task in the schedule IN REVERSE, for each service under that task, shutdown the service (POST /actuator/shutdown)
  # loggers: for each task in teh schedule, for each service under that task, change the logging level of the running service to the configured value (POST /actuator/loggers/*)
  # config: print out this manager configuration
  mode: config

    # Example configuration for running a setup task, then all other services
    # nb. all listed task names must be configured under manager.tasks

    # Examples for running "my-setup" under a "setup" task, "my-service" and "my-other-service" in parallel under a "run-services" task
    # The services-manager moves on to the next task once all services for the current task are either running healthily (/actuator/health) or exited with code 0
    # Once no tasks are remaining, the manager exits with code 0  -  if a task errors, the manager exits with that code
    # nb. all listed service names must be configured under manager.services
