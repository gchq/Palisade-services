# The manager creates a number of commands to execute for each service in manager.services
# All fields are *technically* optional but some (classpath, launcher, main) are probably required to start the spawned JVM process
# Extensive use is made of the eureka discovery client to discover services and endpoints - subsequently the "eureka" profile is enabled by default for all services
# Extract the project version (x.y.z-REVISION etc.)
app:
  version: '@project.version@'
# While the library happens to be the same version as services, it should be declared here as a static name

manager:
  # Defaults used internally to the yaml ONLY - these are not interpreted by any java application, just to minimise duplication of long filepaths etc.
